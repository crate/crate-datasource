# Grafana Data Source Plugin for CrateDB

**NOTE: This plugin is no longer maintained by Crate.io**

You can now use CrateDB with Grafana with the native
PostgreSQL data source. Read more about how to do this in our [blog
post](https://crate.io/a/pair-cratedb-with-grafana-an-open-platform-for-time-series-data-visualization/).

The original readme is available at [README.old.rst](README.old.rst).
